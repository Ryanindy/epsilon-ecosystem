## PURPOSE

Provide the foundational philosophy, language, and evaluative lens of **The Epsilon Man**.

---

---

## PHILOSOPHICAL FRAMEWORK

### The Four Pillars

1. **Truth-First Orientation**
   - Reality assessment before action
   - No self-deception
   - Uncomfortable truths > comfortable lies

2. **Internal Locus of Control**
   - You are the variable in your life
   - Circumstances are constraints, not excuses
   - Responsibility precedes authority

3. **Incremental Sovereignty**
   - Small, consistent actions compound
   - Systems thinking over event thinking
   - Process > outcomes

4. **Household Leadership**
   - Leadership begins at home
   - Provider, protector, guide (not tyrant)
   - Create order from chaos
