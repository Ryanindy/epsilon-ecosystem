## Detailed Content


### Service, Not Tyranny
Leadership is a burden of responsibility, not a privilege of command. To lead a household is to serve its long-term interests, protection, and order.

### Creating Order
The primary duty of the Operator in the home is to metabolize chaos into order. Financial stability, physical safety, and emotional consistency.

### Vision Casting
The leader must articulate where the family is going. Without vision, the household drifts.
