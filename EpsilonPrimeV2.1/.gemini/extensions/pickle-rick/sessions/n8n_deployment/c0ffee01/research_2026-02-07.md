# Research: n8n Process Audit & Environment Mapping

**Date**: 2026-02-07

## 1. Executive Summary
The n8n instance on the Media Server is a standard global npm installation running as a direct `node` process (PID 34604). It uses a local SQLite database for persistence and has active event logging.

## 2. Technical Context
- **Process ID**: 34604
- **Executable**: `C:\Program Files
odejs
ode.exe` (mapped from `CommandLine`)
- **Binary Path**: `C:\Users\Media Server\AppData\Roaming
pm
ode_modules
8n\bin
8n`
- **Command Line**: `"node" "C:\Users\Media Server\AppData\Roaming
pm
ode_modules
8n\bin
8n" start`
- **Configuration Directory**: `C:\Users\Media Server\.n8n`
- **Persistence Type**: SQLite (`database.sqlite`)

## 3. Findings & Analysis
- n8n is started in "start" mode, meaning it's the full engine, not just a worker.
- The `database.sqlite-wal` and `-shm` files indicate active write-ahead logging, confirming the process is healthy and busy.
- The `config` file in `.n8n` is minimal (56 bytes), suggesting most settings are either default or passed via environment variables (which were not visible in the basic CMD audit).
- Event logs are rotating (`n8nEventLog-1.log`, etc.), providing a good audit trail for failures.

## 4. Technical Constraints
- The current process is NOT a Windows Service or a managed PM2 process, meaning if the current shell session or user session ends, the process will likely terminate.
- Port 5678 is dedicated to this instance.

## 5. Architecture Documentation
- Installation follows the standard `npm install -g n8n` pattern.
- Data is siloed in the user's home directory (`$HOME\.n8n`).
