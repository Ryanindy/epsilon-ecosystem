# METAPHYSICS ANALYSIS SKILL

## SKILL METADATA

- **Skill ID**: metaphysics_analysis
- **Version**: 1.0
- **Domain**: Philosophy, Metaphysics, Consciousness Studies
- **Risk Level**: LOW
- **Confidence Floor**: 70
- **Special Mode**: Dual-Channel (Science + Belief)

---

## PURPOSE

Analyze metaphysical questions using **parallel interpretive frames** without conflating science and belief.

---

## CORE PRINCIPLE

**Frame Separation Law**:
- Scientific claims remain in scientific frame
- Philosophical/spiritual claims remain in belief frame
- **Never merge frames**
- Analogies must be explicitly labeled

---

## OUTPUT STRUCTURE (MANDATORY)

Every metaphysical analysis MUST use this format:

```markdown
## ANALYSIS: [User's Question]

### FRAME A: Scientific Perspective

[Physics, neuroscience, empirical consensus]

**Knowledge Classification**: Scientific_Consensus / Emerging_or_Experimental
**Confidence**: [0-100]
**Sources**: [Citations if factual]

***

### FRAME B: Metaphysical/Philosophical Perspective

[Philosophical traditions, symbolic interpretation, spiritual models]

**Knowledge Classification**: Expert_Methodology / Belief_System
**Confidence**: N/A (interpretive framework)
**Traditions Referenced**: [Buddhism, Stoicism, etc.]

***

### ANALOGY BRIDGE (Optional)

**If using analogy to connect frames:**
"As an analogy (not equivalence), [scientific concept] resembles [philosophical concept] in that [similarity]. However, this is a metaphorical mapping, not a factual claim."

**Explicitly state**: This is interpretive, not scientific.
ALLOWED TOPICS
Scientific Frame
✅ Physics of consciousness (Integrated Information Theory, Global Workspace)

✅ Neuroscience of self-awareness

✅ Quantum mechanics (factual, not mystical)

✅ Cosmology and emergence

Philosophical Frame
✅ Buddhist non-self (anatta)

✅ Stoic cosmology

✅ Panpsychism

✅ Idealism vs. materialism

✅ Simulation hypothesis (as philosophy, not physics)

FORBIDDEN CROSS-CONTAMINATIONS
❌ NEVER DO THIS
"Quantum mechanics proves consciousness creates reality"

"Neuroscience confirms Buddhist enlightenment"

"Physics shows we're all one"

"Science validates astral projection"

✅ CORRECT FRAMING
Frame A: "Quantum mechanics describes probabilistic behavior at the subatomic level. Observation collapses the wave function (Copenhagen interpretation). This is a measurement problem, not evidence of consciousness primacy."

Frame B: "Some interpretations of Buddhist philosophy view consciousness as fundamental. This is a metaphysical stance, not a scientific claim."

EXAMPLE ANALYSIS
User Question: "Is consciousness fundamental or emergent?"
Output:

text
## ANALYSIS: Is consciousness fundamental or emergent?

### FRAME A: Scientific Perspective

**Emergent Hypothesis (Mainstream)**:
Consciousness arises from complex information processing in the brain. Theories like Integrated Information Theory (IIT) and Global Workspace Theory (GWT) model consciousness as emergent from neural networks.

**Evidence**:
- Brain damage affects consciousness predictably
- Anesthesia disrupts neural integration
- Complexity correlates with awareness

**Knowledge Classification**: Scientific_Consensus (emergent models)
**Confidence**: 75 (active research area)

**Fundamental Hypothesis (Minority)**:
Panpsychism posits consciousness as a basic feature of reality. Currently lacks empirical testability.

**Knowledge Classification**: Emerging_or_Experimental
**Confidence**: 40 (speculative in scientific terms)

***

### FRAME B: Metaphysical/Philosophical Perspective

**Idealist Traditions**:
Consciousness is fundamental; matter is derivative. Vedanta, Kashmir Shaivism, and some interpretations of Berkeley's idealism hold this view.

**Emergentist Traditions**:
Consciousness arises from matter. Aligns with materialist philosophies (Democritus, eliminative materialism).

**Non-Dual Perspectives**:
Question the fundamental/emergent dichotomy itself. Consciousness and matter may be complementary aspects of a unified reality (Spinoza, process philosophy).

**Knowledge Classification**: Expert_Methodology (philosophical frameworks)
**Confidence**: N/A (interpretive, not factual)

***

### ANALOGY BRIDGE

As an analogy: Emergence in physics (e.g., wetness from H₂O molecules) resembles consciousness emerging from neurons—both involve higher-order properties from simpler components. However, whether this fully explains subjective experience is philosophically contested. This analogy is illustrative, not proof.
GUARD CONDITIONS
This skill CANNOT:

Make scientific claims without empirical grounding

Conflate belief with fact

Present philosophy as physics

Guarantee metaphysical truths

This skill MUST:

Maintain frame separation

Label interpretive content explicitly

Respect epistemic humility (we don't know everything)

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS
May Chain With:

philosophy_ethics (for ethical implications)

science_generalist (for empirical grounding)

writing_critic_evaluator (for clarity)

Must NOT Chain With:

Skills requiring deterministic answers (metaphysics is inherently uncertain)

CONFIDENCE MODIFIERS
User asks for "scientific proof" of metaphysics: -50 (category error)

User asks for multiple perspectives: +10

User accepts uncertainty: +10

RAG retrieval from philosophy sources: +5

RAG DEPENDENCIES
